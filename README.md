# 3D Printing Group

The 3D Printing Group is a site for those who want their models and designs brought to life through the use of 3D-printing, an additive manufacturing process which involves the constant layering of melted plastic in succession. 

People can upload their files to this site where they'll then recieve a quote by email (within 24 hours) which outlines the breakdown of cost and delivery charges. This site is mainly targeted at 3D-printing enthusiasts and for those who want their designs and ideas brought to life.

* Includes a file submit, dropdown menu (for the colors) and contact information blanks for users to upload.
* The centering of the upload area is not inline with the rest the projects elements. Having tried a number of text align styling, this section would still not center correctly.
